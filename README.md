This application allows you to train people by having them watch interactive 360Â° videos. In VR or on a regular computer screen. At this moment you can add interaction points with photos and text, but more are coming:
- Photo albums
- Videos
- Switching to other camera angles
- Multiple choice questions
- ...

The software consists of an editor to create interactive videos, a server where videos will be hosted and a video player.
